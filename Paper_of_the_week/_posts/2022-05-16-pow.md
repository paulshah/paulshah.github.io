Nice paper by [Dalang and Bonvin](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.03616.pdf) on the tension in the distribution of quasars and the CMB 
dipole, identified by [Secrest et al 2020](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14826.pdf). 
In the Secrest paper, the magnitude of the CMB dipole is compared to the magnitude of the dipole inferred from the surface 
density of quasars (which is higher in the direction of the solar system's motion due to abberation). A $5\sigma$ tension 
is found, which is puzzling as in principle both physical effects are straightforward. 
However, Charles and Camille perform an analysis which is nicely simple - nothing more than a Taylor analysis - but 
careful enough to show that the dipole could in principle be explained by redshift evolution of quasar 
luminosities. Establishing whether it's true or not needs more data.

How the dipole tension could be reduced. $$f_{evol}$$ is a parameter capturing the redshift evolution of quasar 
luminosity (units aren't important here). The yellow dashed line implies a $$5\sigma$$ tension with the CMB. However, the blue curve is 
 $$2\sigma$$ off, and the green curve $$1\sigma$$. The purple curve is from limited eBOSS data (errors not supplied by 
the original author).
