title: The quadrupole in the local Hubble parameter
sitemap: false
---

[Dhawan et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.12692) continue the theme of the earlier papers of [Secrest et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07536) and 
[Dalang and Bonvin](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03616) of searching for anisotropy in the distribution of SN Ia relative magnitudes, and whether the 
rest frame of SN Ia is consistent with the CMB. Building on a anistropic cosmographic framework by Heinesen, they look for a 
quadropole in the Hubble parameter and a dipole in the deceleration parameter as signatures of the inhomogeneous expansion of spacetime on intermediate 
scales. Their results are upper bounds, consistent with zero and results from numerical simulations. 

I admit I found the paper difficult to read, and felt the use of different SN Ia samples and methods didn't help. 
Also it wasn't clear to me how some of the simplifying assumptions made were justified (isn't $$\Omega_k$$ relevant to local inhomogeneity?). 
I feel it would have helped if the paper was shorter with a clearer message - for example, it wasn't clear to me if the authors thought the dipole in 
the deceleration parameter and inconsistency between JLA and Pantheon was connected to peculiar velocity adjustments.  

I will revisit this paper a bit later and hopefully I will understand it better then!
