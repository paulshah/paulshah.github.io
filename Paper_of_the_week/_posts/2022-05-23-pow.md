This paper by [Blaineau and Moniez](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.09450.pdf) updates previous results from the MACHO and OGLE microlensing 
surveys. The question of "how much of the galaxy's dark matter is black holes?" was revived in the much-cited paper [Did LIGO detect dark 
matter?](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1603.00464.pdf). The EROS, MACHO and OGLE surveys monitor 
LMC stellar sources for microlensing events caused by compact Milky Way halo objects from $$\sim 1 M_{\odot}$$ 
upwards. The bigger the mass of the lensing object, the longer the event, so they extend the time series to 10 years by merging the 
EROS and MACHO surveys. There are two candidate events, and results are summarised in Figure 5. 

In the range $$2 < M < 120 M_{\odot}$$, the fraction of dark matter than can be made up of black hole is less than 20% at $$2 \sigma$$ confidence.       

I feel one problem is the result (and others like it) always assume a halo density profile, and that the line of sight to the LMC has that profile. 
That would be OK if we were averaging over many lines of sight and many haloes, but for one particular direction out of our galaxy this result 
isn't as strong as claimed (before we even get into primordial vs. stellar origin discussions!).
