# Welcome!

<!--author-->

I obtained my Ph.D in 1995 at [DAMTP](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk), University of Cambridge, UK. 
My thesis was on solitons in quantum field theory, supervised by 
[Nick Manton](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/research/hep/person/nsm10). 
I then held a postdoctoral position at St. John's College, Cambridge, 
but ran off for the bright lights of the City...

I worked in Singapore, London, Chicago and Tokyo trading interest rate derivatives. Latterly, I managed the trading team and quants who wrote the models. 

Wanting to resume research, I took an MSc. in Astrophysics at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/) in 2021. 
I have been part of the Cosmology group, working with [Ofer Lahav](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/astrophysics/professor-ofer-lahav) since 2022.

You can find out about what I've been [working on](/research/), and a list of [publications](/publications). 

And here is my [CV](/assets/CV.pdf).

I have been awarded the [Mayhew Prize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayhew_Prize) by the Faculty of Mathematics at Cambridge, 
the Smith Essay Prize by Girton College, and the Harrie Massey and MAPS prizes by UCL.

I owe a special debt of thanks to Dr. Ruth Williams of DAMTP and Girton College for giving me a chance, 
always.
