Welcome to my blog! I work in the Cosmology group at UCL, and I'm interested in dark-anything and the Hubble constant. 

On these pages you can find some notes about me and my publications. I will add to this blog from time to time, with anything from paper reviews to thoughts on the wider context of science, careers and education.
