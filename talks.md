Giving talks is one of the things I enjoy most about research. I try to give the right talk for the audience I expect. An expert audience will expect a certain level of detail, whereas a more general audience will want some background. And one should never forget to keep the message simple and engaging no matter who the audience is! 

I've given talks to audiences ranging from schools to experts, and some are posted below : 

## It's OK to be wrong

I gave this talk to an audience of 16-17 year old pupils who were doing summer internships at UCL. I wanted to deliver the message that science is experimental, exploratory, surprising and sometimes wrong (but don't try that in an exam)! 

There are many good stories from history, but I selected Einstein's "biggest blunder" : the cosmological constant. [Powerpoint file](/assets/In2science.pptx).
