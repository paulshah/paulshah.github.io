Giving talks is one of the most enjoyable aspects of research, and one has to be careful that the material is at the right level to engage that 
particular audience and be memorable. Some are posted below : 

## It's OK to be wrong

I gave this talk to an audience of 16-17 year old pupils who were doing summer internships at UCL in 2022. I wanted to deliver the message that science is experimental, exploratory, surprising and sometimes wrong (but 
don't try being wrong in an exam)! 

There are many good stories from history, but I selected Einstein's "biggest blunder" : the cosmological constant. [Powerpoint file](/assets/In2science.pptx).

## What can SN Ia tell us about a clumpy universe

This is a talk for a general audience of astrophysicists and cosmologists. 

It has a one-slide introduction to SN Ia cosmology, then goes into  
why it's useful to understand lensing of them and what information that holds. Some results of my papers are presented, plus a look into what 
I'm working on now. [Powerpoint file](/assets/SN_Ia_Sussex_Jan_23.pptx).
